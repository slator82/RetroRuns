-- redundant UI refreshes), false if the new state matched what was
-- already in memory. ComputeNextStep is only called when state changed.

-- Implementation note: the sync builds the new kill set in a local table
-- first, then compares against state.bossesKilled. This avoids a brief
-- window where state.bossesKilled is empty during the iteration, which
-- caused panel-flicker on every zone-change event because ComputeNextStep
-- would briefly pick a different active step before the re-population
-- completed.

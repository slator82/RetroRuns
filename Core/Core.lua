--     May be single-chain (most raids) or multi-chain (Antorus); see
--     NormalizeSkipChains for the shape detection.
--   * skipAchievement: BfD-only sibling field. Mythic-only, gated by an
--     achievement ID. The achievement's per-account "completed" boolean
--     is the 4th return of GetAchievementInfo (since 11.0.5, this is
--     account-wide for any cross-realm earned achievement).
--

-- ceiling-per-chain detail (needed by the Skips UI to render two rows)
-- lives in GetSkipChainCeilings.
-- Detection for the Siege of Orgrimmar Garrosh skip (raid.skipGarrosh).
-- Returns true if the account has unlocked the skip. Two arms, OR'd:
--
--   * statistics: any of the per-difficulty Garrosh kill statistics
--     reading > 0. Covers LFR / Flexible / Normal / Heroic kills. The
--     in-game "--" (no kills) reads as a non-number, so tonumber()..or 0
--     treats it as zero.
--
--   * mythicAchievement: the Mythic Garrosh achievement completed (4th
--     return of GetAchievementInfo, account-wide). Covers Mythic kills,
--     which the kill statistics do not track.
-- Per-difficulty skip state for the Siege of Orgrimmar Garrosh scroll.
-- The scroll is account-wide and difficulty-agnostic: one Garrosh kill
-- on any character at any difficulty unlocks it everywhere. But the
-- client has no single account-wide "any kill" signal, so we infer the
-- state per difficulty from the strongest proof available, four tiers,
-- most-conclusive first:
--
--   Tier 1  Mythic Garrosh achievement (account-wide) completed
--           -> proof of a kill; cascades down. M / H / N all unlocked.
--   Tier 2  either faction's Heroic-or-higher kill achievement
--           (Conqueror = Alliance, Liberator = Horde; both account-wide)
--           completed, no Mythic -> H / N unlocked, M not confirmed.
--   Tier 3  any per-difficulty kill statistic > 0. Statistics are
--           CHARACTER-scoped, so this only confirms the *current*
--           character killed Garrosh -- but a kill is a kill, so the
--           account-wide skip is genuinely unlocked. N unlocked; H/M
--           not confirmed (no achievement to prove the difficulty).
--   Tier 4  nothing proven. The skip may still be unlocked by a kill on
--           another character that left no account-wide trace we can
--           read, so Normal is "unknown" (?) rather than a hard locked;
--           H / M stay not-confirmed.
--
-- Cell values match the Skips renderer's vocabulary:
--   true  = unlocked (green check)
--   false = not confirmed (red X)
--   "?"   = unknown (waiting glyph)
--
-- Returns mythic, heroic, normal.
-- Per-difficulty skip state for the Siege of Orgrimmar Garrosh scroll.
-- The scroll unlocks account-wide on a Garrosh kill, but the client has
-- no single account-wide "any kill" signal, so we grade each difficulty

        -- async pass that runs after the per-row metadata checks). These
        -- run over BOSS loot only. The Encounter Journal indexes boss
        -- encounters and nothing else, so it exposes no trash drops to
        -- compare against; running trash rows through E6/E7 would report
        -- every one of them as an appearance the journal never showed.
        --   [E6] Coverage gap: EJ exposes more sourceIDs for this item at
        --        this difficulty than the data file ships. Without this check,
        --        E1-E4 all pass on valid binary data even when the items

        --   [E7] Missing item: EJ exposes an item at this boss that's not in
        --        the data file at all. Indicates a boss whose loot table is
        --        incomplete, or an item Blizzard added later. Cross-difficulty:
        --        only flagged if missing at every difficulty (so a Mythic-only

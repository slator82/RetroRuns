-- RetroRuns -- WhatsNew.lua
-- Player-facing release notes for the "What's New?" window.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Last-N release entries shown to players when they click the version link
-- in the main panel footer. Hand-maintained at ship time: when CHANGELOG.md
-- gains a new release, prepend a matching entry here and drop the oldest
-- if the list exceeds the display target (currently 5 versions; the
-- window is scrollable so longer note sets fit).
--
-- Voice matches CHANGELOG.md (player-facing, no internal jargon, no
-- developer-facing implementation detail). Most entries are direct lifts
-- from the corresponding CHANGELOG block; the structured form here is
-- what the WhatsNew window's renderer consumes.
--
-- Schema per entry:
--   version  - the version string, no leading "v"
--   date     - ISO date string (YYYY-MM-DD), matches the CHANGELOG date
--   sections - ordered array of sections. Each section is:
--                { heading = "Added"|"Fixed"|..., bullets = { "text", ... } }
--              "heading" matches the H3 used in CHANGELOG ("### Added" etc.).
--              Bullet text may contain WoW color codes; **markdown bold** is
--              rendered as bright white inline via the renderer.

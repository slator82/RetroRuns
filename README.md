# RetroRuns

A solo legacy raid navigator for World of Warcraft retail.

Zone into an old raid and RetroRuns lays out a styled panel with the next boss, turn-by-turn routing to reach it, solo-focused encounter notes, and transmog collection status for every drop. Kill a boss and the guide advances automatically.

**Dungeons** get the same guided routing. Twenty are routed so far: every
Classic dungeon (Ragefire Chasm, Wailing Caverns, The Stockade, Blackfathom
Deeps, Gnomeregan, Razorfen Kraul, Razorfen Downs, Uldaman, Zul'Farrak,
Maraudon, The Temple of Atal'Hakkar, Blackrock Depths, Lower Blackrock
Spire, the three Dire Maul wings and both Stratholme entrances) plus
Scarlet Halls and Scarlet Monastery. The rest of the 123 legacy dungeons,
Classic through Dragonflight, are in the transmog browser with their bosses
and drops, and their entrances are on the travel plane; routes for them are
being added.

## Installation

1. Download the latest `RetroRuns.zip`.
2. Extract it into `World of Warcraft/_retail_/Interface/AddOns/`. You should end up with a folder at `Interface/AddOns/RetroRuns/` containing `RetroRuns.toc` and a handful of `.lua` files.
3. Launch WoW (or `/reload` if already logged in). You'll see a chat banner announcing the RetroRuns version on login.

## Getting started

Zone into any supported raid. You'll get a prompt asking whether to load navigation. Click "Load" and the main panel appears with:

* The next boss to kill (yellow)
* Turn-by-turn travel directions to reach them
* Per-boss solo-play tips
* Achievement callouts with green/red state
* Per-item transmog collection state

The minimap button (a small icon on the edge of your minimap) toggles the panel. Right-click it for settings. Drag it to reposition around the minimap edge.

## Features

* **Optimal solo-clear routes** drawn directly on the World Map, segment by segment. Handles multi-floor transitions and teleporter hops. Auto-advances as you arrive at each checkpoint.
* **Boss progress at a glance.** 3-state indicator (killed / current target / pending) keeps you focused on one objective at a time.
* **Hand-written solo tips** focused on what matters for solo play: what mechanics to worry about, what to skip, Mythic-only gotchas. Not generic Encounter Journal text.
* **Transmog collection tracker.** Per-item, per-difficulty state with cross-source awareness (detects appearances you own via sibling items).
* **Weapon-token vendor hints.** For raids with token-based weapons (Castle Nathria's Anima Spherules), points you to your Covenant Sanctum vendor in your covenant's theme color.
* **Special-loot detection.** Mount, pet, toy, and housing decor drops are surfaced per boss with collection state and clickable links.
* **Achievement callouts.** Per-boss list with completed state and clickable in-game links.
* **Automatic kill detection.** Listens for `ENCOUNTER_END` and syncs with Blizzard's lockout API, so progression state is correct across reloads, disconnects, and character swaps within the same lockout.
* **Configurable.** Font size, window scale, panel position, all persisted per character.
* **Body font choice.** Three options for panel body text: WoW's native Friz Quadrata for max readability, 04B_03 for full pixel-retro feel, or VT323 for a clean terminal style in between. Chrome (title, buttons, footer) stays consistent across all three.
* **Launch mode.** Choose what RetroRuns does on login: open fully expanded, open in compact minimized mode, or stay hidden until you click the minimap icon. Zoning into a supported raid and clicking "Load" always opens the panel fully regardless.
* **Collapsible supported-raids list.** When the panel is idle, the list of supported raids groups by expansion with click-to-expand toggles, so the panel stays compact and you only open the expansion you're working through.
* **Skip detail popups.** The Skips window includes an info button on every raid row that opens the unlock requirements for that raid's skip: what quest, what prerequisite kills, and where the resulting teleporter or shortcut takes you.
* **One-click navigation to raid entrances.** Each supported raid has a flight-master icon next to its name; click it to be routed to the raid's entrance. RetroRuns hands off to whatever navigation addons you have installed; see [Navigation handoff](#navigation-handoff) below for details. Works out of the box with no addons installed (Blizzard's native waypoint), and progressively enhances with TomTom, Zygor, Mapzeroth, AzerothWaypoint, and Waypoint UI as you add them.

## Navigation handoff

The flight-master icon next to each supported raid hands off to whatever navigation addons you have installed. RetroRuns recognizes three different navigation roles and fires the appropriate provider for each:

**Routing**: multi-leg route planning across portals, flight paths, and zones. Supported planners (one fires per click, in this order):
* **AzerothWaypoint with Zygor or Mapzeroth as backend**: AzerothWaypoint orchestrates the backend's route through its own queue UI.
* **Zygor alone**: uses Zygor's LibRover pathfinding and its own arrow.
* **Mapzeroth alone**: uses Mapzeroth's GPS frame with full multi-leg directions.

When a planner is active, it provides its own arrow and destination indicator. No additional waypoint is set.

**Waypoint**: the destination arrow that points you toward the raid entrance. Fires only when no planner is handling the route. Supported sources (one wins per click):
* **TomTom**: drops a crazy arrow waypoint.
* **Blizzard native**: falls back to the in-game super-tracker if TomTom isn't installed.

**3D Overlay**: in-world visual marker at the destination. Fires alongside the planner or waypoint, independently. Either or both can be active at once:
* **AzerothWaypoint**: its 3D queue overlay. When AWP is also handling routing (above), the overlay is part of that dispatch; otherwise it fires standalone.
* **Waypoint UI**: its in-world destination marker and close-range navigator.

The legend at the bottom of the main panel shows which providers are active for your install. None of these addons are required. Blizzard's native super-tracker is the universal fallback when nothing else is installed.

## Reporting bugs / requesting features

A few ways to reach me, in rough order of preference:

* **GitHub issues**: [github.com/PhotekWoW/RetroRuns/issues](https://github.com/PhotekWoW/RetroRuns/issues). Best for bug reports and feature requests; keeps everything searchable.
* **CurseForge comments**: the comments section on the addon's CurseForge page.
* **Email**: [retroruns.support@gmail.com](mailto:retroruns.support@gmail.com). Good for private reports, or anything that doesn't fit a public forum.
* **Discord**: if we're in the same server, feel free to ping me directly.

The Settings panel has a beetle icon (GitHub Issues) and a chat-bubble icon (CurseForge comments) next to the Defaults button as in-game shortcuts to the first two URLs above. Ctrl+C copies the link, paste into your browser.

When reporting a bug, the following info helps:

* Addon version (`/rr status` prints it, or check `RetroRuns.toc`)
* Your class, covenant (if applicable), and the raid + difficulty you were in
* What you expected vs what actually happened
* Screenshot if visual

Built with reference to these addons; none are runtime dependencies, but they were invaluable during development:

* **CanIMogIt**: for the transmog-collection API patterns.
* **TokenTransmogTooltips**: for the weapon-token seed data and tooltip-rendering patterns.
* **AllTheThings**: cross-referenced for loot-table ground truth.
